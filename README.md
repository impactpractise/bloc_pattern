# A repository to explore the bloc_pattern using the bloclibrary.dev

This repository is exploring the bloc pattern to seprate presentation and business logic in our applications. 

We will start by simply adding a bloc to the sample flutter application. However, further down the road we will do cover things like authorization, handling data and testing our application.

Stay tuned and let me know if you have any questions.
